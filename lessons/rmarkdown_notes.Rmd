R markdown is a convinent and professional way to communicate about R code
and your statistical results in a cohesive way. An R markdown file is just a 
plain text file but it has the file extention .Rmd. R markdown files respresent
the combination of a markdown file (.md file) and an Rscript (.R file). 
Markdown is a simple set of tags that allow for formatting of text it was designed 
to be very simple and intutitive. There are lots of resources online about how
to use markdown tags to format plain text. Here is a good one <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/> 

# Using R Markdown in Rstudio

To create an R markdown file simply click on "File > New File > R Markdown". 
If this is your first time ever creating an R markdown file you will be prompted
to install the necessary dependencies. Rstudio should take care of this for you 
but in rare instances will result in errors that need to be chased down via 
google searches. If errors persist I suggest completely removing the R markdown 
libraries from your hardrive and then attempting to reinstall them fresh. 

If their are no errors with installing the R package dependencies you will see a 
dialogue box:

That provides you with a number of different output formating options. 
Notice that if you chose to export to a pdf additional dependencies are 
required. 
Specifically: _*PDF output requires TeX (MiKTeX on Windows, MacText 2013+ on OS X, TeX Live 2013+ on Linux).*_

If you attempt to compile a pdf without installing these additional dependencies
you will recieve fairly informative errors that provide download links and 
specific instructions for how to get the correct dependency. 

## Installing MiKTeX on PC
Unfortunately, although the R error instructions where helpful I still had
to hack around to get this to work on my PC. Here are steps I had to take 

1) download installer at this address <http://miktex.org/download> and run install
2) R markdown still would not compile to pdf because of missing *.sty files
3) Searches online suggested the following additional MiKTeX packages needed
to be installed `framed` and `titling`. Luckily it is relatively easy to use
the MiKTex Package Manager to install these additional two packages.
4) turn off Rstudio and then turn it back on and you should be able to compile
your .Rmd file into a bueatiful .pdf file (hopefully fingers crossed)

## Additional topics to add
* formatting of R code
* error handeling and warnings
* setting options
* running code internally
